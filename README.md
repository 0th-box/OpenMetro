It intercepts tile data requests from apps like News, Weather, and Finance, then feeds them updated info from sources like ESPN or BBC News.  
It’s a preservation + revival project for anyone who misses Live Tiles on the Start Screen.

> For setup instructions, see [here.](./setup.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only **Live Tile data** is restored — the full apps themselves are not functional through this proxy yet.

## Why "OpenMetro"?

"Metro" refers to the bold, typography-focused design language used in Windows 8.x.

"Open" reflects the spirit of open-source — anyone can view, use, and contribute to the project.
